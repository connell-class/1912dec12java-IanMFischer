 * 	what ways can we do it?
 * 		1. Change the number of parameters
 * 		2. Change the parameter type
 * 		3. Change the order
 * overriding
 * child changes the implentation of its parents method 
 * what was can we do it?
 * 	1. change the access modifier
 * 	2. change the return type
 * 		it must be a child of the parent's return type
 * 3. change throw the same or less exceptions than the parent method, but not more or different.
 * 		the rules for overriding a method is known as covarience which gets its name from the return
 * types, since the returntypes must be covarient of each other.
